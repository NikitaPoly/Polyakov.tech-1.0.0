###About
    I decided to make a full stack website with node and typescript. Because I wanted to get comfrotable with the basic building blocks of the internet, no front end or back end frameworks were used exept **NODE**, **TypeSctipy**, and a **MongoDb** instance. **Heroku** was used to host an **https** server from this github repo. In addition to the technologies used in this project, I also learned how to structure a backend and the communications of client and server.gut
