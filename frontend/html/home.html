            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello! I am a college student studying and following my passion of programming. The Russian inside of me loves solving real world problems with the application of math, logic and coding. I also strongly believe that in addition to working out and achieving my goals in physical health, I need to keep challenging my brain and keep it in good health. Becoming a developer helps me achieve this goal. Being a developer is more than just coding, it is solving puzzles and constantly learning. Using the resources you have to not just copy and paste code, but understanding the problem domain and applying technology in an efficient and intelligent way. Not everyone has the time or need to understand technology and all of its nuances, but that is why developers exist. We connect great ideas to tech solutions! We can all agree that programing is a science and skill, but I also argue that there is a sense of artistic value in programing. You must learn the tools and technics to create new solutions for problems people have not solved yet. Without both the know how and a creative mind, one can not become a master programmer. That is why my goal is not to change the world with my skills. I simply wish to master programing to the point where only my creativity is able to limit me. If you would like to join mine and many others journey thru code, don't hesitate to click on the contacts page.</p>
